# Basic-Python
Learn Basic Python about Looping, Break, Continue, And how to Handling Error
****
# Use Case
## Objective Statement :
* Get the insight about For and While Looping in the Python
* Get the insight about Break and Continue in the Python
* To gain new knowledge about Pass 
* To gain new knowledge about the application of  List Comprehension
* Get the insight about Syntax Errors and Exceptions
* Get the new insight about how to Handling Error in the Python
## Challenges :
* Python is a case sensitive programming language, so the writing of the syntax must be considered
## Expected Outcome :
* Knowing more about for and while looping in the Python and realize the difference syntax with other programming languages
* Knowing more about break and continue
* Knowing the function of pass in python
* Knowing the application of list comprehension
* Understanding syntax errors and exceptions in Python
* Knowing how to handling error in the Python
## Benefits :
* As a basic material for learning Python language for beginners
* As additional knowledge about looping, syntax errors and exceptions, handling error, and list comprehension in the Python

# Outlines
## For Looping
* The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, string, tuple, other iterable objects such as range.
* A nesting loop means to loop over a sequence of sequences (a for loop inside another for a the loop).
## While Looping
* While loop is basically used to know how many iterations are required, can execute a set of statements as long as a certain condition is true.
* When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.
## Break
* The break statement is used to terminate (stop) the loop, when a condition is met.
* Use the break keyword with if statement to stop and exit the loop.
## Continue
* The continue statement means skipping the current iteration of a loop and continuing (immediately jumps) with the next iteration.
* Use the continue keyword to skip a block in a loop the current iteration.
## Pass
* The pass statement is used as a code block material, to fill an empty code block. 
* The pass used to be a statement or block of statements (statements), but did nothing to continue execution in order.
## List Comprehension
* List comprehensions are an easy way to define and create lists in Python.
* List comprehension is very useful if the list members we want to create are quite a lot.
## Syntax Errors
* Syntax error is an error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language in Python.
* Syntax errors usually occur when we are just starting to learn Python
## Exceptions
* Exception is the error that occur while the process is in progress
* Exceptions will be fatal if not handled
## Handling Error
* Handling error to resolve the error so as not to stop the program
* Many types and ways to solve errors
